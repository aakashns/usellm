title: React Native AI Chat App
description: An app for chatting created using useLLM and ChatGPT API
---

This documentation is a guide for setting up the React Native AI Chat application
powered by the ChatGPT API. The app is built using the `useLLM` React hook.

> Note: The current configuration and testing of this application is specifically
> for Android. iOS support may require some modifications.

## Application Setup

### Pre-Requisites

To run this application, we need to set up the Android development environment.
If you don't have it ready, follow the instructions based on your development OS
targeting Android from [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?os=macos&platform=android&guide=native).

Here's a list of required software and tools:

- **Node.js**: Needed to run the JavaScript code. Download
  and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- **Watchman**(macOS only): A tool by Facebook for watching changes
  in the filesystem. It's required for macOS. Follow
  the instructions on the [Watchman official site](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install) to install it.

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Needed to run the Android emulator.
  Install JDK from the [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development. Download and install it from the [Android Studio's official site](https://developer.android.com/studio).

- **Android SDK**: The Software Development Kit for Android, which comes bundled with Android Studio.

- **Android SDK Platform**: Choose the specific Android platform version in Android Studio's SDK Manager.
  It's recommended to select the latest stable version. It

- **Android Virtual Device (AVD)**: The emulator used to run the Android application. Set this up in Android Studio's AVD Manager.

**Android SDK**, and **Android Virtual Device** can be installed together
while installing the **Android Studio**.

After installation, you should have the following environment variables set up:

- **JAVA_HOME**: This should point to the directory where JDK is installed. To add
  Java to $PATH follow this [tutorial](https://www.scaler.com/topics/java/setup-java-home-and-ide-on-mac-os/)
- **ANDROID_HOME**: This should point to the directory where the Android SDK is installed.

### Setting Up the Project

Once you have your Android development environment ready, you can set up the project.
Start by creating a fork of the original [repository](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app) and
cloning it locally or opening it in codespaces.

After you're in the IDE, follow these steps:

1. **Install project dependencies**: Navigate to the project root directory in your
   terminal and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies specified in `package.json`.

```shell
npm install
```

2. **Start the Metro server**: Metro is a JavaScript bundler for React Native.
   Start it by running `npm run start` from your terminal.

```shell
npm run start
```

After starting the Metro server, you'll be prompted with options. Select `a - run on Android`.
After the build finishes, you should see the running app on your emulator/device.

### Building the APK

By default, this process uses the debug key to build the APK, which should be fine for development purposes. However, if you wish to publish the app on the Google Play Store, you would need a release key. Follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) to set up a release key.

To create a release build, navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run:

```shell
npm run release
```

The release APK will be located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`.

Congratulations, you have now successfully set up and built the React Native AI Chat application on your Android device.

## Development Guidelines

This guide will help you understand the structure of our React Native Android application
repository and suggest the key areas and files where you can use for development.
This is a template project so you can fork this repository and use it as a starting point
to develope and create your own project.

### Important Files in the Repository

Here are the crucial files that you need to understand before developing:

1. **[App.tsx](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/App.tsx)**: This is the main entry point for the app. Any root level configuration would go in here.

2. **[index.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/index.js)**: This file is used to register the main App component with React Native.

3. **[package.json](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/package.json)**: This file includes the metadata about the project like the project dependencies, scripts, versions, etc.

4. **[package-lock.json](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/package-lock.json)**: This is an automatically generated file that is used to pin the dependencies to specific versions for consistent installs.

5. **[tsconfig.json](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/tsconfig.json)**: Configuration file for TypeScript. It includes the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

6. **[src/pages/ChatScreen.tsx](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/src/pages/ChatScreen.tsx)**: This file handles the Chat screen of the app. Most of the chat functionalities are defined here.

7. **[android/](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/tree/main/android)**: This directory contains all the files related to the Android app development. The app's APK build process is handled here.

8. **[babel.config.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/babel.config.js)**: This file contains configurations for Babel, which we use to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a
   backward-compatible version of JavaScript.

9. **[metro.config.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/metro.config.js)**: Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. This file contains configuration details for it.

10. **[./android/gradle.properties](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/android/gradle.properties)**, **[./android/settings.gradle](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/android/settings.gradle)**, and **[./android/build.gradle](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/android/build.gradle)**: These are configuration files for Gradle,
    the build system used in Android development.

11. **[tailwind.config.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-react-native-app/blob/main/tailwind.config.js)**: This file is the configuration for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

### Ideas for Future Work

Here are some files where you could potentially make changes and some suggestions for what those changes could be:

1. **App.tsx**: Since this is the entry point of the application, you might want to introduce new components,
   change the navigation structure or modify the overall look and feel of the application.

2. **src/pages/ChatScreen.tsx**: As a main feature of the application, this could be a good area to update.
   You could improve the user interface, add additional features to the chat, or optimize the existing features.

3. **android/**: You could potentially make changes to the build process of the Android.
   This could involve modifying build configurations, adding new build scripts, etc.

4. **`package.json`**: You can add new dependencies that might enhance the app.

5. **`babel.config.js` & `metro.config.js`**: You can optimize the configurations for Babel and Metro to
   improve the performance of the application.

6. **`tsconfig.json` & `tailwind.config.js`**: As these files configure TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, any
   improvements to type-checking, styling, and design can be made here.

7. **Gradle configuration files**: If you have ideas to optimize the build system, you might want to look
   at `./android/gradle.properties`, `./android/settings.gradle`, and `./android/build.gradle`.

Remember, the above are just suggestions, feel free to explore other areas as well.
