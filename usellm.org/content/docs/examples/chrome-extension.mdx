description: AI-powered Chrome extension for summarizing webpages
---

Use this starter template for a handy Chrome extension that leverages the power of
the ChatGPT API to summarize web pages. It's built using the `useLLM` react hook.

### Setting Up the Extension Locally

Before installing the extension on your Chrome browser, you need to set it up locally. Follow the steps below to do so:

1. First, go to [Webpage Summarizer Repository](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension) and fork it to your own account

2. Next, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

   If the username is "XYZuser" and repository name is "webpage-summarizer", this will be the clone command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/XYZuser/webpage-summarizer.git
   cd webpage-summarizer
   ```

3. Then, navigate to the `app` directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

4. Finally, run the nodemon watcher script by executing:

   ```shell
   npm run watch
   ```

### Installing the Extension on Chrome

Once you've set up the extension locally, you can install it on your Chrome browser:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. At the top-right corner, toggle on the `Developer mode` switch
3. Click on the `Load unpacked` button
4. In the dialog that opens, navigate to the `extension` folder inside the cloned repository and select it
5. Your extension should now be visible among your other extensions in Chrome

### Important Files in the Repository

Here's a brief description of some of the important files in the repository:

- **[./extension/content.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/extension/content.js)** - This file injects functionality into web pages. It communicates with the background
  script and manipulates the DOM of the webpage.
- **[./extension/manifest.json](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/extension/manifest.json)** - This is the extension's configuration file. It specifies basic metadata about the
  extension like its name, description, version, and permissions it requires.
- **[./extension/readability.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/extension/readability.js)** - A standalone version of Mozilla's readability library. It's used to parse the web
  page and improve its readability.
- **./extension/index.html** - The HTML structure of the popup that appears when you click on the extension icon.
  This is gitignored as it is automatically generated when running the command `npm run watch`.
- **[./app/pages/index.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/app/pages/index.js)** - This is the entry point of the application where the main App component is defined.
- **[./app/jsconfig.json](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/app/jsconfig.json)** - This file guides the JavaScript language service in Visual Studio Code to determine where
  the base directory of the JavaScript project is located.
- **[./app/package.json](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/app/package.json)** - Contains metadata about the app. This includes the name, version, description, and dependencies.
- **[./app/postcss.config.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/app/postcss.config.js)**,
  **[./app/tailwind.config.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/app/tailwind.config.js)** and **[./app/next.config.js](https://github.com/usellm/example-chrome-extension/blob/main/app/next.config.js)** - Configuration files for PostCSS,
  Tailwind CSS and Next.js respectively.

### Ideas for Further Development

Here are some ideas for further development and improvement of the extension:

1. **Improving the Prompt for Summarization**: Currently, the prompt used for generating the summary may be quite generic.
   Experiment with various prompts to improve the quality of the summarization. Consider implementing an A/B testing setup to
   measure the effectiveness of different prompts. This could involve using different prompts to different users, and then
   collecting feedback or usage data to determine which prompts produce the best summaries.

2. **Add Context-Based Q&A Using Embedding**: Enhance the extension's interaction
   capabilities by introducing a context-based Q&A feature. This can be powered by the useLLMs
   useEmbedding API. This API can generate embeddings for the text in the current webpage,
   which can then be used to provide more context-aware answers to users' questions.

3. **Implement Chat Feature**: Currently, the chat feature is not implemented. Consider adding a feature that allows
   users to interact with the extension and get contextual answers from the webpage. This would likely involve sending
   the contents of the current webpage or the user's selected text to the ChatGPT API, and then displaying the generated
   responses in the extension's popup window. Be sure to design the UI in a way that makes it clear to users that they're
   chatting with an AI model, and consider adding features like a chat history or the ability to save favorite responses.

4. **Add Authorization (Sign Up/Login) Feature**: Add a sign-up/login feature to control usage and potentially implement
   rate limiting in the future. This could involve setting up a simple backend service to manage user accounts.

5. **Add support for other browsers**: The extension currently only works with Chrome. You could work on making
   it compatible with other browsers such as Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

6. **Integration with other APIs**: Besides the ChatGPT's chat API, consider integrating other APIs to extend the
   functionality of the extension. For instance, a translation API could be used

7. **User Customization**: Allow users to customize the extension's settings to their liking. This might include
   changing the appearance of the popup window, adjusting the length of summaries, or toggling certain features on or off.

8. **Enhanced Summarization Features**: Improve the summarization algorithm by implementing advanced NLP
   techniques or integrating with other summarization APIs. Also consider adding features like topic extraction
   or keyword highlighting to make the summaries more useful.

9. **Integration with Note-Taking Apps**: Allow users to save the summaries directly to their favorite note-taking
   apps or cloud storage services. This would make it easier to store and access the summaries later.

10. **Performance Improvements**: Analyze the performance of the extension and look for ways to make it faster and
    more efficient. This might involve optimizing the code, reducing the size of the extension, or improving how it interacts with web pages.

11. **User Feedback Collection**: Implement a feature to collect user feedback directly through the extension.
    This could help you understand how users are using the extension, what features they find most useful,
    and what improvements they would like to see.
