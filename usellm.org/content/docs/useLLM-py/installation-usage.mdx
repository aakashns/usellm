title: Installation and Usage of LLM in Python App 
description: Run useLLM in Python Environment 
---

`useLLM` is a library to help you build and create applications powered by Large Language Models. 
Follow this tutorial to implement useLLM in your Python app. 
This part of the documentation is Python specific. You can find the version for javascript here: https://usellm-f2gp49cmk-jovian.vercel.app/docs


## Installation

To get started, install `useLLM` with the following command:

```shell
pip install usellm
```


## Example Usage 

Here is a basic usage example:

```python
from usellm import Message, Options, UseLLM

# Initialize the service
service = UseLLM(service_url="https://usellm.org/api/llm")

# Prepare the conversation
messages = [
  Message(role="system", content="You are a helpful assistant."),
  Message(role="user", content="What can you do for me?"),
]
options = Options(messages=messages)

# Interact with the service
response = service.chat(options)

# Print the assistant's response
print(response.content)
```


The above code will generate a response using the OpenAI ChatGPT API. The service URL "https://usellm.org/api/llm" should be used only for testing.
