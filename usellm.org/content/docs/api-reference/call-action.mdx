title: llm.callAction
description: Invokes custom server-side actions with provided options.
---

`llm.callAction()` is a client-side method that is part of the `useLLM` hook.
It allows developers to call custom actions that were registered on the server
side using the `llmService.registerAction()` method.

The `callAction()` function makes a POST request to the LLMService with a provided
options object and returns the response.

### Syntax

```javascript
const { data } = await llm.callAction(actionName, options);
```

### Parameters

- `actionName` - A string that defines the name of the action to be called.
- `options` - An object that provides the necessary options for the action.
  The structure of this object depends on the requirements of the specific action being called.

### Returns

`llm.callAction()` returns a Promise that resolves to the data returned by the server-side action.
The structure of the returned data depends on the specific action being called.

## Example

Here's an example of how to call a custom action. In this case, we are calling
the `replicateText` action that was registered on the server([live demo](http://usellm.org/demo/register-action)).

To know how we are registering `replicateText` action to `useLLM` check the [**llmservice.registerAction**](http://usellm.org/docs/api-reference/register-action) page.

```javascript
"use client";
import useLLM from "usellm";
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function RegisterActionDemo() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState("");
  const llm = useLLM({
    serviceUrl: "/api/llm",
  });

  async function handleGenerateClick() {
    setAnswer("");
    const { data } = await llm.callAction("replicateText", {
      text: text,
    });

    setAnswer(data["output"]);
  }

  return (
    <div className="p-4 overflow-y-auto">
      <h2 className="font-semibold text-2xl">Register Template Demo:</h2>
      <div className="flex my-4">
        <input
          className="p-2 border rounded mr-2 w-full dark:bg-gray-900 dark:text-white"
          type="text"
          placeholder="Enter a text here"
          value={text}
          onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button
          className="p-2 border rounded bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200 active:bg-gray-300 dark:bg-white dark:text-black font-medium ml-2 "
          onClick={handleGenerateClick}
        >
          Send
        </button>
      </div>

      <div>Answer:</div>
      <pre>{answer}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `replicateText` action is called when the 'Send' button is clicked, passing the
input text as an option to the action. The response from the action is then set as the answer and displayed on the screen.

With the `llm.callAction()` method, you can extend the functionalities of your client-side application by
leveraging custom actions registered on the server side.
