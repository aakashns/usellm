description: Clones a voice using the LLM service
---

`llmService.cloneVoice()` is a server-side function in the useLLM framework that clones a voice using the LLM (Language Model as a Service) service and play.ht API. It allows users to provide an audio URL of their recorded voice and a voice name, and it returns a unique voice ID that can be used to generate audio in the cloned voice.

### Syntax

```typescript
const { voiceID } = await llmService.cloneVoice({
  audioUrl: string,
  voice_name: string,
});
```

### Parameters:

`llmService.cloneVoice()` accepts an object of type LLMCloneVoiceOptions with the following properties:

- **audioUrl** (required): A string representing the URL of the user-recorded voice audio.
- **voice_name** (required): A string representing the name of the cloned voice.

### Returns:

This method returns a Promise that resolves to an object with the following property:

- **voiceID**: A string representing the unique ID of the cloned voice.

### Error Handling:

`llmService.cloneVoice()` may throw an error if:

- The `audioUrl` parameter is missing or undefined.
- The `voice_name` parameter is missing or undefined.
- An error occurs during the API request to the play.ht service.

### Example

Below is an example of how to use `llmService.speak()` within a server-side function:

```typescript
/* pages/api/clone-voice.ts */

import { createLLMService } from "usellm";

export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

const llmService = createLLMService({
  playHtApiKey: process.env.PLAYHT_API_KEY,
  playHtUserId: process.env.PLAYHT_USER_ID,
  actions: ["cloneVoice", "generateClonedAudio"],
});

export default async function handler(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();

  try {
    const options = {
      audioUrl: body.audioUrl,
      voice_name: body.voiceName,
    };

    const { voiceID } = await llmService.cloneVoice(options);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ voiceID }), { status: 200 });
  } catch (error: any) {
    return new Response(error.message, { status: error?.status || 400 });
  }
}
```

In this example, the `llmService.cloneVoice()` method is used to clone a voice using the LLM service and play.ht API. The `options` object is constructed with the user's audio URL and voice name. The `llmService.cloneVoice()` method is then called with the options object, and the resulting `voiceID` is returned as the response. If an error occurs, an appropriate error response is returned.

Make sure to replace `clone-voice.ts` with the appropriate endpoint name and customize the implementation as per your requirements.
