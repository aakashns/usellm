description: Converts text to speech using the LLM service
---

`llmService.speak()` is a server-side function in the useLLM framework that converts text to speech using the LLM (Language Model as a Service) service. It sends a request to the Eleven Labs API with the provided text and voice settings, retrieves the generated audio, and returns the audio URL.

### Syntax:

```typescript
const { audioUrl } = await llmService.speak({
  text: string,
  model_id?: string,
  voice_id?: string,
  voice_settings?: { stability: number; similarity_boost: number }
});
```

### Parameters:

`llmService.speak()` accepts an object of type LLMServiceSpeakOptions with the following properties:

- **text**: A string representing the text to be converted to speech.
- **model_id** (optional): A string representing the ID of the LLM model to be used. If not provided, the default model ID is used.
- **voice_id** (optional): A string representing the ID of the voice to be used for speech synthesis. If not provided, the default voice ID is used.
- **voice_settings** (optional): An object specifying voice settings such as stability and similarity boost.

### Returns:

This method returns a Promise that resolves to an object with the following property:

- **audioUrl**: A string representing the base64 encoded data of the generated audio.

### Error Handling:

`llmService.speak()` may throw an error if:

- An error occurs during the API request to the Eleven Labs service.

### Example

Below is an example of how to use `llmService.speak()` within a server-side function:

```typescript
/* pages/api/llm.ts */

import { createLLMService } from "usellm";

export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

const llmService = createLLMService({
  elvenLabsApiKey: process.env.ELVEN_LABS_API_KEY,
  actions: ["chat", "transcribe", "speak"],
});

export default async function handler(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();

  try {
    const options = {
      text: body.text,
      model_id: "your_model_id",
      voice_id: "your_voice_id",
      voice_settings: {
        stability: 0.8,
        similarity_boost: 0.5,
      },
    };

    const { audioUrl } = await llmService.speak(options);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ audioUrl }), { status: 200 });
  } catch (error: any) {
    return new Response(error.message, { status: error?.status || 400 });
  }
}

```

In this example, the `llmService.speak()` method is used to convert text to speech using the LLM service. The `options` object is constructed with the desired text, model ID, voice ID, and voice settings. The `llmService.speak()` method is then called with the options object, and the resulting `audioUrl` is returned as the response. If an error occurs, an appropriate error response is returned.
