title: llm.cosineSimilarity
description: Utility function to compute the cosine similarity between two vectors
---

The `llm.cosineSimilarity` function computes the cosine similarity between two vectors `vecA` and `vecB`.
This function is often used in natural language processing and information retrieval to measure the similarity
between two text documents, by viewing them as vectors in a high dimensional space.
In essence, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.

The cosine similarity varies between -1 and 1. A value closer to 1 indicates higher similarity,
while a value closer to -1 indicates high dissimilarity.

The cosine similarity is calculated as follows:

```plaintext
cosine_similarity = dot_product(vecA, vecB) / (magnitude(vecA) * magnitude(vecB))
```

The `dotProduct` method calculates the dot product of two vectors, while the `magnitude` method computes the magnitude of a vector.

### Syntax

```javascript
const similarity = cosineSimilarity(vecA, vecB);
```

### Parameters

- **`vecA`**: A number array representing the first vector.
- **`vecB`**: A number array representing the second vector.

### Returns

This function returns a number that represents the cosine similarity between two vectors.

### Example

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of `cosineSimilarity`:

```javascript
"use client";
import useLLM from "usellm";
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function EmbedDemoPage() {
  const [documentText, setDocumentText] = useState("");
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState("");
  const llm = useLLM({ serviceUrl: "https://usellm.org/api/llm" });

  async function handleSubmit() {
    const paragraphs = documentText.split("\n").filter((p) => p.length > 0);
    const { embeddings: docEmbeddings } = await llm.embed({
      input: paragraphs,
    });
    const { embeddings: queryEmbeddings } = await llm.embed({
      input: question,
    });

    // Calculate similarity between the first paragraph and the query
    const similarity = llm.cosineSimilarity(
      docEmbeddings[0],
      queryEmbeddings[0]
    );
    console.log("Cosine similarity: ", similarity);
  }

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 8 }}>
      <textarea
        maxLength={2000}
        rows={10}
        value={documentText}
        onChange={(e) => setDocumentText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        value={question}
        onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Ask a question about the document"
      />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Calculate similarity</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the embeddings of the document and the query are first obtained using the embed function.
The cosine similarity between the first paragraph and the query is then calculated using the cosineSimilarity
function. The result is logged to the console. This gives us a measure of how similar the question is to the
first paragraph of the document.
