description: Run, test, and add features to useLLM and contribute to the project!
---

If you're interested in contributing to the `useLLM` project, that's fantastic!
This guide will walk you through the setup process.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository. You can do this by visiting the
[useLLM repository](https://github.com/usellm/usellm) and clicking on the 'Fork'
button in the top-right corner. This will create a copy of the repository
under your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Develop in Codespaces

Codespaces provides a complete, configurable development environment in seconds.
To open the forked repository in Codespaces, navigate to your forked repository
and click on the 'Code' button. Then, select 'Open with Codespaces' and create a
new codespace.

#### Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the directory structure in the useLLM project:

- **Root Directory**: The root directory contains the core files and folders of the project,
  including `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `package.json`, and `.gitignore`, among others.

- **`/packages/usellm`**: This directory contains the npm package for the useLLM project.
  It includes the source code and tests for the React hooks that interface with LLM APIs
  like Open AI. The `package.json` in this directory lists the dependencies required for
  this package.

- **`/usellm.org`**: This directory contains a Next.js application, which serves as the
  project's documentation site and demo application. Here, you'll find source files,
  components, pages, styles, and scripts required for the application. The `package.json`
  file in this directory lists the dependencies required for this application.

The Next.js application in the `usellm.org` directory directly copies over the useLLM
package in real time during development, making it easy to test changes to the useLLM package.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Once the codespace is ready and you're in the development environment, you will need
to install the necessary dependencies for the project. Navigate to the `usellm.org`
directory in the terminal and run `npm install`.

```bash
cd usellm.org
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

### Step 4: Run Development Server

Once the installation process is finished, you can run the development server.
In the `usellm.org` directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server. Press the "Open in Browser" button or Cmd+Click
the localhost URL to view the application in a new tab.

### Step 5: Make Changes

Feel free to make changes to the codebase, either within the `usellm.org` NextJS app or within
the `usellm` package! The `usellm.org` application is set up to copy over the `usellm` package
in real time, so any modifications you make to the `usellm` package can be automatically
tested on the `usellm.org` application.

Here are some good places to start:

- Improve the documentation by making changes in the folder `usellm.org/content/docs` (edit the `.mdx` files)
- Add or improve/modify demo applications within the `usellm.org/app/demos` folder
- Fix bugs or add new features to the `usellm` package within the `packages/usellm` folder
- Browse through open issues on the [useLLM repository](https://github.com/usellm/usellm/issues) and see if you can help out!

### Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your changes and they're thoroughly tested, commit them to your
branch (you can either work on your `main` branch itself, or create a feature branch e.g. `my-new-feature`).

Push your branch to your remote copy of repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then, navigate to your [original repository](https://usellm.org/usellm) on GitHub, where you can create a new pull request by [following this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Please make sure to provide a thorough description of your changes, the motivation behind them, and any additional context that would aid the reviewers. All tests and checks must pass before your changes can be merged.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `useLLM`! Your efforts help make this project better for everyone.
